# nano-COP

Nanopore analysis of CO-transcriptional processing (nano-COP) exposes the nascent transcriptome via stringent purification of nascent RNAs and direct long-read RNA-sequencing through nanopores. Nano-COP allows to visualize the physical distance between transcription and splicing, as well as splicing order and coordination across multi-intron transcripts.

This repository includes the scripts and annotation files needed to analyze nano-COP data:
- Python scripts used to make each figure in the manuscript
- Additional Python scripts to make datasets required for the figure scripts
- Bash scripts to make some of the annotation files
