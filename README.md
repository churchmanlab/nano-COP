# nano-COP

Nanopore analysis of CO-transcriptional processing (nano-COP) exposes the nascent transcriptome via stringent purification of nascent RNAs and direct long-read RNA-sequencing through nanopores. Nano-COP allows to visualize the physical distance between transcription and splicing, as well as splicing order and coordination across multi-intron transcripts.
