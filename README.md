# nano-COP

Nanopore analysis of CO-transcriptional processing (nano-COP) exposes the nascent transcriptome via stringent purification of nascent RNAs and direct long-read RNA-sequencing through nanopores. Nano-COP reveals the physical distance between transcription and splicing as well as splicing order and coordination across multi-intron transcripts.

This repository includes the scripts and annotation files needed to analyze nano-COP data. The "annotation_files" folder contains gene feature coordinates from human and Drosophila datasets that are utilized for analyzing nano-COP datasets. The "scripts" folder includes the python code to make necessary datasets and plots for each figure in the manuscript.
